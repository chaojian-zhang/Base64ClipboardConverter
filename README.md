# Base64 Clipboard Converter

This tool converts an image from clipboard to Base64 format, suitable to be embedded in Markdown.

The implementation of such a tool requires some kind of desktop API support because clipboard is an operating system feature. On the other hand, the general conversion process can be done in just a CLI program.
